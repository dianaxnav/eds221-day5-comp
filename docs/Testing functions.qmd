## Write a function

```{r}
# 1 is rows, 2, is cols for margin
mean_range <- function(df) {
  col_means <- apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE) 
  col_mean_max <- max(col_means)
  col_mean_min <- min(col_means)
  return(c(col_mean_min, col_mean_max))
}
```

```{r}
mean_range(mtcars)
mean_range(faithful)
```

```{r}
#testing the function 

expect_length(mean_range(mtcars), 2) #If nothing happens that means its working 

expect_length(mean_range(mtcars), 3) #error will come if you have it wrong

expect_type(mean_range(mtcars), "double")
```

```{r}
#Make sure mtcars from first row is less than or equal to max mean range
expect_true(mean_range(mtcars)[1] <= mean_range(mtcars)[2])

```
